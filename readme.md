# server
A production-ready server framework that was actually used by me for production servers.

Main features:
* based on Netty4
* auto-detecting of annotated request handlers via Spring
* auto-assigning annotated HTTP request handlers to URLs
* asynchronous processing of requests with preservation of responses order

[Example of an HTTP server](https://github.com/stIncMale/server/tree/master/src/test/java/stinc/male/server/example)
